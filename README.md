# Parallelerizationing...OR..examples of prarallel-procsessing.
Example programs using different types of parallel processing concepts.
Watch in amazement as we take simple run-of-the-mill problems and totally
parallel-erize them into super fast rockets of computation!


**for anyone wondering, yes, we know the grammar is absolutely terrible,
BUT the programs are real**
